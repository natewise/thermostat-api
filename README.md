# thermostat-api
Inside the theromstat-api folder is the "api" thermostat.js and data_generation.js. 
Run data_generation.js first to get dummy thermostat data generating for the main api.
Run thermostat.js next to connect to the data_generation.js socket to begin populating the thermostat's register.
Run client_2.py for an external connection to the thermostat api. Includes bidirectional socket comm.
